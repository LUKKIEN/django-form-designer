* Integration with [Django CMS](http://www.django-cms.org): Add forms to any page
* Use drag & drop to change the position of your form fields
* Fully collapsible admin interface for better overview over your form 
* Implements many form fields included with Django (TextField, EmailField, DateField etc)
* Validation rules as supplied by Django are fully configurable (maximum length, regular expression etc) 
* Customizable messages and labels
* Supports POST and GET forms

Installation
------------

This document assumes that you are familiar with Python and Django.

1. [Download and unzip the current release](http://github.com/philomat/django-form-designer/downloads/), or install using `git` as shown below (the latter two commands are necessary to pull submodule dependencies):

        $ git clone git://github.com/philomat/django-form-designer.git
        $ cd django-form-designer
        $ git submodule init
        $ git submodule update

2. Make sure `form_designer` is on your `PYTHONPATH`.
3. Make the directory `form_designer/media/form_designer` available under your `MEDIA_ROOT`.
4. Set up the database tables using 

	$ manage.py syncdb
 
5. Add `form_designer` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.

        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            ...
            'form_designer',
        )

6. Add the form_designer URLs to your URL conf. For instance, in order to make a form named `example-form` available under `http://domain.com/forms/example-form`, add the following line to `urls.py`. Note: __If you are using the form_designer plugin for Django CMS, step 5 is not necessary__:

        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            (r'^forms/', include('form_designer.urls')),
            ...
        )

7. Add the form_designer admin URLs to your URL conf if you want to use CSV export. Add the following line to `urls.py` _before_ the admin URLs:

        urlpatterns = patterns('',
            (r'^admin/form_designer/', include('form_designer.admin.urls')),
            ...
            (r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
        )

Optional requirements
---------------------

* form_designer supports [django-notify](http://code.google.com/p/django-notify/) for error messages and success notifications. If it is installed in your project, it will be used automatically, and you need to output the `{{ notifications }}` variable in your templates.
* The form_designer admin interface requires jQuery and the jQuery UI Sortable plugin to make building forms a lot more user-friendly. The two Javascript files are bundled with form_designer. Optionally, if Django CMS is installed, the files bundled with that app will be used. If you want to use you own jquery.js instead because you're already including it anyway, define JQUERY_JS in your settings file. For instance:

        JQUERY_JS = 'jquery/jquery-latest.js'

Missing features
----------------
  
* File upload fields should be implemented
